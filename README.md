# channelUI_IoT
A repository for a water-meter at University of Ibague using IoT

This repository contents:
- source codes.
- dev scripts(Python|ROS)

## Hardware elements
- Raspberry PI B +
- Strato PI UPS  "https://www.sferalabs.cc/strato-pi/" Version UPS
- Hokuyo UST-10LX Scanning Laser Rangefinder "https://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/search/single.php?serial=167"
- MaxBotics sonar "https://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/MB7360.htm"
- WiFi dongle

## Software requirements
- Raspbian
- Python 2.7.15,
*numpy, scipy, rospy
- Matlab 2017 R1 "only for the development"
- ROS kinetic 1.12.13

## Installing the Strato Pi utility on Raspbian
 `cd /usr/local/bin`
 `sudo wget http://sferalabs.cc/files/strato/strato`
 `sudo chmod 755 strato`

You can run the Strato Pi utility without arguments to print its options:
`strato`
```
Usage: strato beep on|off|length_millis|length_millis pause_millis repeats
       strato watchdog enable|disable|heartbeat|timeout
       strato shutdown
       strato battery
```
### Installing the Real Time Clock software [Strato pi]
 `sudo raspi-config`
 `sudo apt-get update`
 `sudo apt-get install i2c-tools`
 `cd`
 `wget http://sferalabs.cc/files/strato/rtc-install`
 `chmod 755 rtc-install`
 `sudo ./rtc-install`

If the script completes with no errors, delete the installation script and reboot:
 `rm rtc-install`
 `sudo reboot`

Testing the Real Time Clock:
 `date`
 `sudo hwclock -r`  Read Date
 `sudo hwclock -w`  Write Date

Edit /boot/config.txt and add these lines at the end of the file:
 `# Disable Bluetooth`
 `dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt`

Then: `sudo systemctl disable hciuart`

Disable the ttyAMA0 console service:
`sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service`

Disable the ttyAMA0 console service:
`sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service`

Edit the /boot/cmdline.txt file and delete the serial console configuration:
`console=serial0,115200`

for more information use the strato references.

## ROS Installing.
For ROS install you must follow the next steps:

*http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi

Install de Hokuyo node for ROS

*`rosinstall_generator urg_node robot_upstart --rosdistro kinetic --deps --wet-only --tar > kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall`

*` wstool merge -t src kinetic-custom_ros.rosinstall`
*` wstool update -t src`
*` sudo ./src/catkin/bin/catkin_make_isolated --install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release --install-space /opt/ros/kinetic`

## Repository Folders

```
/your_root        - path
|--com          / scripts for communication based on IoT
|--init         / Init files
|--LiDAR        / scripts for Hokuyo sensor
|--register     / scripts for recording data and log files
|--sonar        / scripts for sonar sensor
monitor.py      / system monitoring script
channel         / main script
```

## Use Folders.
In the folder `ROS` , the contents of catkin_ws/src must be copied to your own catkin workspace.

## How to config?
### Ini coms
* Create Two wpa_supplicant.conf  files on /etc/wpa_supplicant/
*  put your SSID and passwords into wpa_supplicant_0.conf for wlan0 and SSID and passwords into wpa_supplicant_1.conf for wlan1:

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GB
network={
    ssid="ssid_name"
    psk="password"
}
```
* edit the /etc/network/interfaces file:
```
auto lo
#allow-hotplug lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant_0.conf

auto wlan1
allow-hotplug wlan1
iface wlan1 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant_1.conf
```
* config a static ip address on /etc/dhcpcd.conf file

### Init upstart RosCore and Nodes

On your Pi, edit the file /etc/rc.local using the editor of your choice. You must edit with root, for example:

```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
Add commands below the comment, but leave the line exit 0 at the end, then save the file and exit.

Inside the `rc.local` you need to add path of channel.sh:

```
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

/home/pi/......../channel.sh

exit 0

```
